# 32KB-Flash-Cart

this is my 32KB flash cart that i created. do note its pretty much the same as the insideGadgets 32KB flash card linked below as i followed their guide on youtube and got their advice on the flash chip to use. You will also require a GBxCart from insideGadgets yo load a rom onto ther cart.

The chips needed for the cart are the SST39SF010A, you can source them yourself or here is the aliexpress link for the ones i bought.
